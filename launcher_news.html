				Chase the Dragon Rebrand (5/25/2019)
			</h3>
			With the recent passing of JD, Chase the Dragon's Co-Founder, I've taken it upon myself to rebrand again. Some of it is done. Some of it still needs me to actually spend time to fix. Regardless, yeah, that's what Launcher Version 1.3.0 is all about.<br />
            Soon, we'll have a new modpack to play. I wanted to make this really special, in rememberance of JD. This pack is called CTD Omega. It is unknown when it will be complete.
